This publication of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control
("OFAC") is designed as a reference tool providing actual notice of
actions by OFAC with respect to Specially Designated Nationals and
other entities whose property is blocked, to assist the public in
complying with the various sanctions programs administered by OFAC.
The latest changes may appear here prior to their publication in
the Federal Register, and it is intended that users rely on changes
indicated in this document that post-date the most recent Federal
Register publication with respect to a particular sanctions program
in the appendices to chapter V of Title 31, Code of Federal
Regulations.  Such changes reflect official actions of OFAC, and
will be reflected as soon as practicable in the Federal Register
under the index heading "Foreign Assets Control."  New Federal
Register notices with regard to Specially Designated Nationals or
blocked entities may be published at any time.  Users are advised
to check the Federal Register and this electronic publication
routinely for additional names or other changes to the listings.
Entities and individuals on the list are occasionally licensed by
OFAC to transact business with U.S. persons in anticipation of
removal from the list or because of foreign policy considerations
in unique circumstances.  Licensing in anticipation of official
Federal Register publication of a notice of removal based on the
unblocking of an entity's or individual's property is reflected in
this publication by removal from the list.  Current information on
licenses issued with regard to Specially Designated Nationals and
other blocked persons may be obtained or verified by calling OFAC
Licensing at 202/622-2480.  The following changes have occurred
with respect to the Office of Foreign Assets Control Listing of
Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons since January 1,
2016:
